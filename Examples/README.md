# CC:Tweaked Example Programs

The programs within these folders are examples that can be used as a reference or to make your own programs, some of these are written in an extensible manner with comments further detailing what they do and how to extend them.

Due to amount of addons available for CC:Tweaked, the files or folders will either be prefixed with a shorthand identifier for the addon, or in the case of programs that only use CC:Tweaked, they will prefixed with `CC:T:`

These scripts may break at any time due to updates to Minecraft, the CC:Tweaked mod, or addons.
