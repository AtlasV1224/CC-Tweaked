# CCCreate Backport
This is a collection of scripts written with a custom build of the peripheral support for blocks added by Create 6, support for the new blocks isn't official and isn't in the Create mod hence the custom packport. 

These scripts **__WILL NOT WORK__** without a custom build. these scrpts are also very likely to break or not work when official support is added

## Scripts
### PackagerTurtle.lua
Combines the sign, lever, and inventory for the outbound packager all into one block, leading to more compact setup
