## About

The AV Package Manager is a package manager built for the CC: Tweaked programs I have made.  

The main goal is to have an easy way to select and install packages without trying to remember or find the clunky pastebin/github link, the script is mirrored over at [AtlasV.info/AVPackageManager](https://atlasv.info/avpackagemanager) as an easy access point to use with `wget run`.

When the script is ran, it automatically fetches a list of programs from the [CCTweakedPrograms.json](https://github.com/AtlasV1224/CC-Tweaked/blob/main/PackageManager/CCTweakedPrograms.json) file and displays them in a GUI for easier selection.
